# trustFundSmartContract
An **Ethereum Smart Contract** to create trust funds for my future kids.


Created an **Ethereum Smart Contract** which has following functions:
1. Add addresses to different 'kids'.
2. Withdraw the amounts after fixed time.
3. Add addresses for multiple 'kids'.

Smart Contract was made secure by providing the access to constructor 'admin' for modifications.
Code was also optimised to lower the gas fees.

Deployed and tested on RemixIDE for Ethereum:
